Already proved:
 - a profile x* is NE iff:
  - for every player and pure strategy the expected payoff of switching to that pure strategy will be less than staying with the mixed strategy x_i
Further:
 - let:
  \phi_{i,j} = max (0, U_i(x_{-i};\pi_{i,j} - U_i(x)))
Note:
 - now going to stop taking math notes, all in slides
 - going to note intuitive points made in lectures
f:
 - how behave in real world
 - assign weights
 - learn payoffs
 - maps profile of mixed strategies to profile of mixed strategies
 - profile is prob dist
 - By brouwer, there exists x* s.t. f(x*) = x*
 - hence x* is a fixed point of this function
 - have to prove the \phi_{i,j} is equal to zero
 - show that zero for one j
 - then zero for all j
Corollary:
 - If in NE:
  - every player, if they unilaterally change to strategy they play with +ve probability they would be no better off
  - that new switch is not a NE
Remarks:
 - Proved exists, now have to find it
 - Start with 2-player zero sum games
Zero Sum:
 - I win = You lose
 - Solve with Linear Programming
Applications in Biology:
 - John Maynard Smith
 - Evolutionary Stable Strategy
 - Mixed strategies used to model %s in population that exhibit different behaviours
 - Aggressive pigeons
 - Extra Reading Straffin (1993): 
  - amusing introduction
 - behaviours affect each other's survival
 - in evolutionary equilibrium if no mutant strategy could invade and take over
Symmetric:
 - strategy space is the same
 - game looks the same from point of view of both players
 - not every symmetric game has ESS
ESS:
 - x1* is best response to itself
 - different best response is worse off against itself
Pareto Optimal:
 - No other profile that will increase one player's payoff without decreasing other peoples
Prisoner's Dilemma:
 - Shows NE need not optimize social welfare, nor be Pareto Optimal
 - Coop, Coop give better payoff to both but Defect, Defect is also NE
