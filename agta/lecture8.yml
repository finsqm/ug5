LP Duality:
 - Oh dear there's a proof in the coursework
 - duals work with equalities too
 - rules:
  - non neg in primal (up to r):
   - ineq in dual
  - non neg in dual (up to d):
   - ineq in primal
  - equalities for unconstrained vars
  - dual of the dual is the primal
 - Minimax:
  - maximise v
  - st:
   - v minus expected payoff for p1 under all pure strat for p2 is non-positive
   - x is prob dist
  - dual:
   - maxminimiser for player 2
  - optimal value of both LPs are the same
  - LP duality theorem implies minimax theorem
  - Minimax is also consequence of Nash's Theorem
  - Hence can derive strong duality from Minimax theorem
  - Proof:
   - Consider 2p zero sum game
   - B:
    - block matrix (contains smaller matrices) from slides
   - symmetric zero sum game
   - this game is the same for both players
   - -B^T = B
   - value of game is zero
   - every minmaximiser is a maxminimiser
   - Consider:
    - symmetric minimax profile
    - symmetric NE
    - both players playing same strategy
    - ends with constant z
   - Suppose:
    - z > 0
   - feasible solutions for primal and dual pop out
   - Claim:
    - if feasible solutions for both then z +ve
    - use Farkas Lemma
 - Farkas Lemma:
  - see slides
  - one direction is easy:
   - results in 0x < 0
 - Significane of LP duality: 
  - combinatorial optimization
  - mathematics economics
  - helpful to construct dual in real life situations
  - optimise real economic counter goal
  - duality in algs:
   - NP and co-NP
  - gives bounds for integer LP
