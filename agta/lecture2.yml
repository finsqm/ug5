Finite Strategic Form:
 - "N = {1,...,n} of players"
 - "S_i = {1,...,m_i} pure strategy for player i":
  - enumerates possible actions/strategy, i.e. one move game
 - S = S_1 x ... x S_n set of possible combs of pure strategies
 - u_i : S -> R, utility u_i(s_1,...,s_n) to player i under combination of strategies
Mixed Strategies:
 - x_i is dist over S_i
 - x_i = (x_i(1), ..., x_i(m_i))
 - sums to 1
 - uses randomness to decide which strategy to play
 - X_i is set of mixed strategy for strategies for player i
 - X = (X_1 x X_2 x ... x X_n) is all possible combs, or profiles, of mixed strategies
Expected Payoff:
 - x(s) := \product{j=1}{n} x_j(s_j)
 - U_i(x) := \sum{s \in S} x(s) * i_i(s):
  - expected payoff for player i under mixed stratgy profile x \in X
 - assumption:
  - everyone is trying to maximise their expected payoff U_i(x)
  - may not be true, risk takers, risk averse etc.
Notation:
 - pure strategies:
  - x_i PURE if one hot vector
  - picks exactly one strategy
  - denoted by \pi_{i,j}
 - everybody else's strategy:
  - x_{-i}
 - new profile with y_i:
  - (x_{-i}; y_i)
Best Response:
 - U_i(x_{-i}; z_i) \geq U_i(x_{-i}; y_i)
 - z_i is best response
 - if you could cheat you would pick z_i
 - Nash Eq:
  - everybody is playing strategy that is best response to everybody elses
Mixed Nash Equilibrium:
 - if x_i is best response for all i
 - PURE if x_i == \pi_{i,j}
 - Nash's Theorem: EVERY FINITE n-PERSON STRATEGIC GAME HAS A MIXED NASH EQUILIBRIUM

Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem:
 - "Every continuous function f: D -> D mapping mapping a compact and convex, nonempty subset D \in R^m to itself has a fixed point, i.e. the is x* \in D s.t. f(x*) = x*"
 - The set of profiles X is a compact and convex subset of R^m
 - m = \sum{i=1}{n} m_i
 - m_i = |S_i|
 - crumpled sheet experiment: 2d case
 - deep and important proof of topology
 - proof outside scope of course
 - proof:
  - "[Milnor’66] (Differential Topology). (uses, e.g.,
Sard’s Theorem)"
  - "[Scarf’67 & ’73, Kuhn’68, Border’89], uses
Sperner’s Lemma."
  - "[Rotman’88] (Algebraic Topology). (uses
homology, etc.)"
  - "[D. Gale’79] , uses the fact that HEX (a finite,
extensive form game of perfect information, reinvented
by Nash) is a “win-lose” game, i.e.,
any n-dimensional Hex game has a winner (i.e.,
can not end in a draw)"
Proof of Nash's Therorem:
 - "define f : X -> X"
 - if f(x*) = x* then x* = (x*_1, ..., x*_n)
 - fixed point <--> Nash Eq
 - Claim:
  - x* is NE iff: U_i(x*) \geq U_i(x*_{-i};\pi_{i,j})
  - forward direction obvious proof
  - U_i(x*{-i};x_i) = \sum{j=1}{m_i} x_i(j) * U_i(x*_{-i};\pi_{i,j})
  - i.e. payoff for i is weighted average of payoffs of it's pure strategies
  - if ineq holds then:
   - U_i(x*) \geq U_i(x*_{-i}; x_i) for all x_i
   - because weighted average of things no bigger than U_i(x*) cannot be bigger the U_i(x*)
  - hence x*_i  is best response strategy to x*_{-i}.
  - hence x* is a Nash Equilibrium
Unilateraliy:
 - if everyone stays the same and only you change
