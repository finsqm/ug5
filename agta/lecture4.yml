# Lecture 4
- Topics:
 - 2-player zero sum games
 - Minimax
- Don't know how to compute NE yet
- Iterate and hope it converges?:
 - lousey
2 player zero sum:
 - predates theory of NE
 - von neumann
 - payoff sums to zero
 - payoff viewed as matrix
 - A2 = -A1
 - player 1: row player
 - player 2: column player
Notation:
 - matrix ineq hold for all values
 - typically deal with column vectors
Mixed Strategy:
 - m1 dim vector x, for player 1 with m1 possible actions
 - prob dist
Expected Payoff:
 - x1^T A x2
Rock Paper Scissors:
 - Can achieve expected payoff 0
Minimax:
 - maximise the worst thing that could happen
 - imagine revealing mixed strategy to opponent
 - player two is maxminimizing
 - Note:
  - if player 1 reveals strategy
  - i.e. reveal x1*
  - expected payoff will be less than or equal to player 2's strategy
  - still less than or equal to if player 2 reveals
  - von neumann showed actually equality
  - only holds with optimum strategy
Minimax Theorem:
 - exists unique value v for game st:
  - expected payoff to player 2 if playing j against x1* >= v
  - vice versa <= v
  - v is expected payoff when players are playing optimally (minimax)
 - x* = (x1*, x2*) is NE
 - v is 0 in fair game
 - v is minimax value
Proof:
 - Uses Nash's Theorem
 - original proof came before NE
Remarks:
 - Minimax profile and NE are same for 2pzs
 - any strategy played with positive probabilities will achieve expected payoff v
As optimization problem:
 - maximise v
 - constraints:
  - expected value for p2 strategy j is >= v for all j
  - player 1 strategy sums to one
  - each prob in x is non neg
 - solve with linear programming
Note:
 - still just one shot game
 - normal form, not extensive form
