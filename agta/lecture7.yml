# Lecture 7 (missed 6 - simplex)
LP Duality:
 - can write primal LP in matrix form
 - adversary wants to minimise bound on LP
 - x feasible solution to primal LP
 - y feasible solution to dual LP
 - Strong Duality:
  - optimal solutions are equal between primal and dual
  - weird!
  - LPs are in different dimensions
 - Complementary Slackness:
  - optimal iff:
   - for each primal constraint:
    - equality or var = 0
