# Lecture 3
- Weiner Kernels Discrete Time:
 - Linear fitting problem / regression
 - Least Squares
 - Solve for Mean Squared Error
 - Derivation on website
 - psuedo inverse
 - s_t : stimulus at t
 - r_t : response at t
- Fourier Transform in linear case:
 - Transform to freq space
 - g1 represents impedence of system:
  - how much wiggle you need for output
- Regularization:
 - Try not to overfit
 - punish fast fluctuations
 - smooth prior
- So far looked at temoral kernels
- Spatio-Temporal Kernels:
 - best response when something is moving
 - diagonal path through x/t domain
 - motion detectors
 - doesn't respond to static stimulus
- Higher-order:
 - include higher order heads to more accurate estimates
 - comes at cost
- Spike Triggerd Average:
 - whenever neuron is responding, look at stimulus
 - just the linear kernel
 - for linear systems, under constraint, optimum stimulus is prop to g_1(-t)
- Membrane Potential:
 - compare to underlying voltage
- Spike Triggered Covariance:
 - for higher order kernels
 - matrix when neuron responded (for quad)
 - symmetric
 - hence eigenvectors are orthonormal basis
- Simple Cell:
 - linear filter + rectif
 - visual system
 - video with light bar, nobel prize
 - V1
- Complex Cells:
 - "g1 = 0"
 - not linear
 - pools responses from simple cells + rectif
 - XOR
 - first term is G2
 - STC:
  - A: eigenvalues sorted by mag, want to see some pop out
  - D: STA is basically zero
- LNP models:
 - Linear-nonlinear-posisson model
 - more tailored to neuron system
 - spiking and noisey
 - common model
 - linear filter (kernel) + non-linearity + poisson spiking
 - n is non-lin:
  - sig
  - rectif
 - if poisson process:
  - not homogeneous, varies in time
 - not bad approx in mammals
 - test by plotting mean against var
- Estimation of LNP:
 - don't care about non-lin
 - can still use STA if p(s) is symmetric
 - if stimulus leads to certain kernel then also stimulus on other side
 - symmetric response about k
 - kernel is the same as lin kernel
- Continous Case:
 - Bussgang 1952
- LNP results:
 - caviat: time scales are fairly course
- Trend:
 - general system: works on any system
 - more specific: better but less general
