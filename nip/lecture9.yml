# Lecture 9 - missed a lot
Neural Networks and Visual Processing:
  - Perceptron:
    - Good model for Cerebellem
    - Cerebellem:
      - Big Neurons
      - Motor System
      - Big Parallel fibres
      - Error signal:
        - climbing fibre for reporting errors
      - Experiments:
        - Eye Velocity vs retinal slip
        - very fast
        - move head, eyes move to stay in same spot
        - perceptron learning models well
    Limitations:
      - XOR (of course)
      - Problem has to be linearly seperable
  - MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron):
    - Now is becoming a neural net
    - Learn with backprop
    - Hurray, finally something I already know
    - SGD
    - Regularize with L2
    - More layers do not add any more theoretical power but work well in practice
  - Auto Encoders:
    - Make input same as output
    - find efficient representation of input
    - fewer hidden units than input
  - Backprop in Biology:
    - 2 phase learning
    - Adds feedback weights
  - Convolutional Networks:
    - Fukushima
    - Share Weights
    - HMAX:
      - Simple Cells
      - Complex Cells
      - Retina stuff
      - Conv and max pool
      - Max pool:
        - nice way to get invariances
      - no learning between layers
    - learning problems become easier in high dim space:
      - lots of cells
      - basically cheating
  - Learning Invariances:
    - Hard code
    - Supervised Learning
    - use temporal continuity of world:
      - Trace Rule
      - fitler output based on time
    - Slow Feature Analysis:
      - Minimize derivative of output
      - translation invariance biology approach
    - Altered Visual World:
      - Rhino allows follows dog
      - NN learns this
  - Top Down Interactions:
    - Feedback connections
    - Nose detector fires, but where is the nose?
  - Recurrent Neural Networks:
    - Dynamic
  - Liquid State Machines:
    - Interconnected Networks
    - Random Connections
    - Weights on outputs
    - lots of computational power
    - Maass et al 2002
    - Optimal Reservoir?:
      - Golden middle ground
      - Between ordered and chaotic
    - Related to SVM
