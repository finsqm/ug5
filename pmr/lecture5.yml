Bayes Nets (Belief Networks):
 - Directed Graph
 - Thinking:
  - tease apart direct and indirect causes
 - Latent Var: hidden
 - Starting Point: joint dist
 - chain rule of probability
 - dependent on n:
  - encode with 2^n numbers
  - if binary vars
 - utilise cond indep
 - Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
 - Factor Graphs:
  - 1 to 1 relationship between directed acyclic factor graph and BN
  - multi input vars do lose some inf
 -
